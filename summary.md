## ðŸ“ˆ Overall Summary

This dashboard provides a holistic view of the global sales performance of a fashion retail brand across years, countries, cities, and customer segments. With a peak in 2024 and a subsequent decline in 2025, the focus must shift to diagnosing and addressing this sales dip.

Asia, especially cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai, dominates the revenue landscape, with key customer loyalty and preference for premium categories. The dominance of credit card payments signals a mature, digitally fluent customer base.

Sub-category analysis indicates that product lines like Coats and Blazers are major revenue drivers. Strategic decisions on geographical focus, product portfolio refinement, and enhanced customer engagement will be critical for reversing the sales downturn in 2025 and ensuring sustainable growth.

Additionally, discount impact analysis reveals that highest sales figures were achieved with minimal discounting, emphasizing perceived value and strong brand equity. This opens opportunities to reinforce premium positioning while avoiding excessive markdowns.

Furthermore, performance disparities across regions and stores highlight the urgent need for localized inventory, marketing, and customer experience strategies. The underperformance of stores in Europe versus Asiaâ€™s strength reinforces the need for market-specific actions.

By leveraging these data-driven insights, the company can prioritize high-yield markets, streamline operations in lagging areas, and drive long-term profitability through informed, strategic decisions.
